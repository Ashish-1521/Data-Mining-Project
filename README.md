# Project Overview 
This project aims to analyze and provide insights into the evolving landscape of the video game industry over the past 20 years (2000-2020). By examining key factors such as game genres, publisher sales, regional sales distribution, platform preferences, and critic ratings, the project seeks to help publishers make informed decisions to enhance their sales and navigate the competitive market effectively.

## Objectives
Identify Popular Game Genres: Determine which game genres have been the most popular and how they impact sales.
Evaluate Publisher Performance: Assess the sales performance of top publishers and understand their strengths in game development.
Analyze Regional Sales Distribution: Explore market dynamics and sales distribution across different regions.
Platform Preferences: Examine which platforms are preferred by gamers and their influence on game sales.
Strategic Recommendations: Provide actionable insights for publishers to increase sales and succeed in the video game market.
## Key Findings
Genre Analysis: Adventure, Shooter, and Sports genres consistently show high sales across all regions. Board games, while fewer in number, have shown potential growth.
Publisher Sales: Sony achieved the highest sales despite releasing fewer games, indicating that focusing on less competitive genres can be more profitable.
Regional Sales Distribution: Major regions like North America, Europe, and Japan each contribute significantly to overall revenue, with Asia being a key market for testing new genres.
Platform Preferences: PC and PlayStation platforms are favored, with high average sales. Asia's sales are notably high regardless of critic scores, suggesting unique market dynamics.
## Recommendations
Target Less Competitive Genres: Developing games in genres like Fighting or Board Games for popular platforms such as PC, PS3, and PS4 can lead to increased recognition and sales.
Focus on Popular Genres: While Adventure and Sports genres present opportunities for high sales, the intense competition makes it challenging for new games to stand out.
Leverage Regional Preferences: Utilize the high sales potential in Asia and other key regions to test and launch new game genres.
## Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains 13,763 rows and 14 columns, including information on game titles, publishers, sales across different regions, release year, genres, critic ratings, and platforms. Data preprocessing involved removing null and duplicate values and encoding variables into the required format for analysis.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis serves as a valuable resource for industry stakeholders, including publishers, developers, and analysts, to gain insights into trends, patterns, and opportunities in the video game industry from 2000 to 2020. By understanding these dynamics, publishers can make strategic decisions to enhance their market presence and sales performance.
